Intern Web Designer, Medtronic Science and Technology - Fridley, MN
Summer 2007
Researched, tested, and began implementing a new structuring style to an internal websiteâ€™s codebase to promote code reuse and reduce maintenance.
Worked on both front end graphic layout and back-end data processing.
Learned necessary coding languages (Coldfusion 7, javascript) through self-study and minimal tutoring from peers.
