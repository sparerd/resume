	\qquad I am excited to apply for the Development Operations Engineer position in your Eden Prairie, MN office. I have a B.A. in Computer Science (Management Info Systems concentration) and over 8 years in the field of computing, with each position requiring greater technical aptitude and responsibility. My key strengths that make me a good fit for this position include:
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=.5in]
		\item Experienced in supporting applications in a massive SaaS environment
		\item Several successful automation initiatives
		\item Strong understanding of software engineering
		\item Self-motivated and eager to learning new things
	\end{itemize}

	\qquad In my current work with Pearson, I have focused on automating common workflows and creating the requisite tooling to enable further automation in PowerShell. In many cases, this has required adapting an existing API (REST/SOAP/local exe) into something more easily consumed by the rest of the library. This has allowed us to aggregate data from a large array of different monitoring tools, automate account creations, and simplify application recovery.
	
	\qquad In early 2016 I wanted to become more engaged in the open source community. I took over as the project manager and lead developer for the open source program mRemoteNG (https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG). One of the first things I did was setup a build and test pipeline using Jenkins hosted on AWS. This has allowed us to automate a large portion of our release workflow. Currently, I lead development efforts along with one other contributor.

	Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. I look forward to speaking with you soon about how I can contribute to the success of Spok and its customers.
