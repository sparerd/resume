	\begin{cvletter}

		\lettersection{Hi!}
		They say that if you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life. I feel like that's the case with me, because I've been able to fit my passion for automation in nearly every job I've held. You can imagine my glee when I saw that the job requirements of the Development Operations Engineer position at Spok read like my bucket list. Between this cover letter and my resume, I'm eager to show you why we are a great fit for one another.

		\lettersection{About Me}
		I have a B.A. in Computer Science (Management Info Systems concentration) and over 8 years in the field of IT, with each position requiring greater technical aptitude and responsibility. As a senior technical analyst in Pearson's Operations Command Center, I'm accustomed to supporting a massive environment of diverse systems and applications. In my spare time, I lead development efforts for the open source project mRemoteNG, as well as creating automated CI/release pipelines. I enjoy learning about software design, system architecture, testing methodologies, and release strategies.

		\lettersection{Why Spok?}
		Every job is a two way street, and I feel that Spok is a great fit for me. I am impressed with Spok's culture of collaboration and learning. Almost every comment I've seen from current and former employees mentions how willing everyone is to share knowledge and lend a hand. I want to be a part of Spok's mission to cultivate efficient communication in the health care industry.

		\lettersection{Why Me?}
		My diverse background in development and operations has given me a holistic understanding of the SDLC. I've worked heavily with building CI and release pipelines in Jenkins for the mRemoteNG project as well as leading development efforts in C\#. My history of creating custom automation at Pearson has had a lasting impact on the effectiveness of my team. I am an avid lifelong learner who craves a challenge.


		I want to bring my inquisitive nature and attitude of experimentation to overcome obstacles that Spok faces today. Give me a call and let's build great products together!
